## üöÄ Features

- **Advanced ML Models**: Three trained models (CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest) for accurate match predictions
- **Player Database**: Comprehensive player statistics and historical data
- **Smart Search**: Find players by name or country code
- **Prediction Interface**: Get match predictions with confidence scores and winning odds
- **Modern Web Interface**: Clean, responsive design built with SvelteKit
- **REST API**: FastAPI backend with comprehensive endpoints

## ü§ñ Model Performance

The system uses three different machine learning models, with CatBoost as the default:

| Model | Accuracy | ROC AUC | Log Loss |
|-------|----------|---------|----------|
| **CatBoost** (Default) | 67.21% | 0.73 | 0.60     |
| XGBoost | 66.70% | 0.73 | 0.61     |
| Random Forest | 65.70% | 0.72 | 0.62     |

## üìä Feature Engineering

The models are trained on 137 carefully engineered features including:

- **Player Characteristics**: Entry type, playing hand, physical attributes
- **Match Context**: Tournament level, surface type, date, draw size
- **Performance Metrics**: Aces, double faults, service statistics
- **Historical Data**: Head-to-head records, recent form (last 5, 10, 20, 50 matches)
- **Ranking & Elo**: Current rankings, Elo ratings, surface-specific performance
- **Comparative Analysis**: Differential features between players

- `GET /players/{player_id}` - Get specific player information
- `GET /players-lookup` - Search players by name or country code

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project uses Git LFS (Large File Storage) for dataset files. You'll need to install and configure Git LFS:

```bash
# Install Git LFS (if not already installed)
# On macOS with Homebrew:
brew install git-lfs

# On Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install git-lfs

# On Windows, download from: https://git-lfs.github.io/

# Initialize Git LFS
git lfs install
```

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

1. **Clone the repository and pull LFS files**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hikmatazimzade/tennis-ai.git
   cd tennis-ai
   git lfs pull
   ```

2. **Run with Docker Compose**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
   - API Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Option 2: Local Development

1. **Clone the repository and pull LFS files**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hikmatazimzade/tennis-ai.git
   cd tennis-ai
   git lfs pull
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   # Install UV (if not already installed)
   pip install uv
   
   # Install dependencies
   uv sync
   
   # Run the backend
   uv run uvicorn backend.api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd ui-app
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Access the application**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000

## üí° How to Use

1. **Browse Players**: Visit the players page to explore the database of tennis players
2. **Search Players**: Use the search functionality to find specific players by name or country
3. **View Player Details**: Click on any player to see their detailed statistics and performance history
4. **Make Predictions**: Go to the prediction page, select two players, and get AI-powered match predictions with confidence scores
